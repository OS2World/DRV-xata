
		      Daniela's S506 ADD - Release 1.8.12
		      -----------------------------------

== How to report problems ==
============================

// Daniela had this to say...
// To those people who still don't understand the meaning of REQUIRED:
// Do not ask if the info is, simply generate it - even if you think you
// can't do that - and attach it  -  UNCONDITIONALLY, ALWAYS, WITHOUT ASKING!

// Before sending the report.* files, check if they contain data! The first line
// of report.trc and report.atapi shows the version of the loaded
// driver and the options given. The first line of report.dumpide shows the build
// date of the DumpIDE utility

You must attach the required data to EACH bug or problem report:

Make sure that you are running the STANDARD version of DaniS506.ADD.

Make sure you are running the most recent GA version of Danis506.ADD and
DaniATAPI.FLT, unless specifically instructed otherwise.

If you are not sure what version you are running, check it before you submit a
ticket.

Many people refer to driver revisions by file dates. Don't try to do this for
these reasons:

  - We don't keep track of file dates
  - We may build several drivers almost each day
  - File dates can easly be changed
  - There are many different calendars in this world

The only valid reference is the driver's version number. It is shown on
boot up if the /V or /W switch is given. If you can boot to a command line
the output of "COPY IBMS506$ anyfile" will list the driver version in
the first line. If you cannot boot, then run "BLDLEVEL DaniS506.ADD" which
will output something like this:

     Signature:       @#slainc:1.8.11#@##1## 2012/04/27 11:28:58 ...
     Vendor:          slainc
     Revision:        1.08.12
     Date/Time:       2012/04/27 11:28:58    
     Build Machine:   slamain
     File Version:    1.8.12   <-----------------------------+
     Description:     Adapter Driver for PATA/SATA DASD      |
							     |
     This is the full version number  -----------------------+

To collect data for a support ticket, add the option /DEBUG:-31 to the 
DaniS506.ADD line in CONFIG.SYS, and reboot.  Open up a command line session 
and enter the following commands

  copy IBMS506$ report.trc

and

  DiskInfo cviI > report.diskinfo

and

  DumpIDE b > report.dumpide

If the "Total errors" lines of report.diskinfo are not all zero, enter the follow command

 SmartCtl -a DiskID > report.smart

where 'DiskID' is the id of the disk with errors.  For example, use '0m' if DiskInfo shows
errors for unit '0/m'.

Attach all the reports to the ticket.

If you are experiencing problems related to any kind of ATAPI unit (CD, DVD,
burners, ...), then enter the command

  COPY ATAPI$ report.atapi

and attach report.atapi to the ticket.

If you cannot boot from the hard disk using DaniS506.ADD, try the above from a
bootable floppy, CD or ZIP.

If this fails as well, edit config.sys and add the options 

  /FORCEGBM /!BM

to the DANIS506.ADD BASEDEV statment and try again.

If all of the above fails, but a boot with IBM1S506.ADD works, then grab
at least

 - the output from "DumpIDE b > report.dumpide"
 - the output from "BldLevel DaniS506.ADD > report.bldlevel"
