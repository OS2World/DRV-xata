How to build danis506.add

== Toolchain ==

  Microsoft C compiler for OS/2 (from IBM DDK)
  Borland tasm (from wherever you can get it)
  nmake (from IBM DDK)
  nelite (from Hobbes)
  4OS2 (from Hobbes)
    if using make.cmd

== Prerequisites ==

  DANIS506 Sources

    Sources must live in DDK tree for now
    This was the IBM DDK way of doing things
    Eventually the makefile will be updated to be more flexible

    Create a working directory at same level in the DDK source tree as ibm1s506
    (i.e. \ddk\base\src\dev\dasd\yourname\danis506)

    Checkout the sources with

      cd \ddk\base\src\dev\dasd\yourname\danis506
      svn checkout http://svn.netlabs.org/repos/xata/ATA/trunk .

  ACPI toolkit

    Danis506 currently uses a private, 16-bit compatible
    version of the ACPI toolkit.
    This will eventually be deprecated by a 16-bit ACPI toolkit
    maintained as part of the ACPI project.

  LIBOBJ

    LIBOBJ is a set of object file extracted from the MSC runtime libraries.
    The makefile ensure that these get included into the binary by the linker.
    This method ensures not the linker does not include unexpected runtime
    library routines

    Checkout the LibObj subdirectory with

      svn checkout http://svn.netlabs.org/repos/xata/LibObj/trunk LibObj

    or point LIBOBJ environment variable at an existing copy

== First Time Setup ==

  - Checkout danis506 sources

  - Populate LIBOBJ subdirectory

  - Set environment variables - see makefile

== Building ==

  - If using 4OS2, run make.cmd

  - Otherwise, set environment variables and run nmake directly
