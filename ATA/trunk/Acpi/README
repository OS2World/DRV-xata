Danis506 ACPI interface notes
07 Sep 2010

The standard ACPI headers no longer support 16-bit platforms or 16-bit
compilers.

This directory tree contains a modified, minimal subset of ACPI PSD headers
as of ACPI svn changeset 292.  See src/acpi/common/include.

These headers have been modified to recognize the MSC compiler and generate
definitions that are correctly packed and sized.

References to unused headers have been deleted from acpi.h

Code that needs modification to support the 16-bit MSC compiler has been
wrapped in _MSC_VER #ifdefs.

Code that would generate spurious warnings (bsekee.h) has been wrapped
in _MSC_VER #ifdefs.

Unused code that would generate compile errors has been wrapped in _MSC_VER
#ifdefs.

The following warning is expected

Acpi\bsekee.h(485) : warning C4040: memory attribute on 'pfnHook' ignored
