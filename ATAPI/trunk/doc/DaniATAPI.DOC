
		  Daniela's generic ATAPI Filter - Release 0.4.0
		  -----------------------------------------------


NAME
     DaniATAPI.FLT  -  replacement for IBMIDECD.FLT, IBMATAPI.FLT, DaniADsk.FLT
		       and all other ATAPI related filters.

SYNOPSIS
     This filter driver supports all types of ATAPI devices. It is a superset
     of IBMIDECD.FLT, IBMATAPI.FLT and DaniADsk.FLT, and supports all devices
     that the mentioned drivers do.
     Additionally, all ATAPI devices can be accessed through the OS/2 ASPI
     software interface. Each EIDE channel shows up as a SCSI channel, and
     each ATAPI device as a SCSI device (master = SCSI ID 0, slave = SCSI ID 1).

DESCRIPTION
     This release of my ATAPI filter driver is based on the IBMATAPI.FLT and
     IBMIDECD.FLT sources.

     My enhancements are:

     - can deal with the ATAPI ZIP-250 and ZIP-750
     - improved ZIP performance (up to factor 4 on ZIP-250)
     - supports arbitrary swapping of 100MB, 250MB and 750MB media
     - reflects the current media capacity up to FDISK, DISKIO or the like
     - OS/2 boot from ZIP is possible
     - faster 32bit PIO in conjunction with DANIS506.ADD (rel. 1.1.1 or later)
     - Busmaster DMA mode works and is tested with Intel, VIA, AMD, HPT, SiS,
       CMD, SiliconImage, ServerWorks, Promise, Nvidia and ACARD chipsets until
       now.
       Busmaster DMA is available now for ALi as well (CD/DVD-ROM is safe, but
       some chip revisions fail on DMA write operations!). Due to hardware
       limitations there is no 32bit PIO and no busmaster DMA possible for ATAPI
       devices attached to a Promise Ultra (non-TX2) controller.
     - ATAPI devices appear to the rest of the system as regular SCSI-2 devices
       if used with DANIS506.ADD (rel. 1.1.5 or later). This may be disabled
       globally or individually.
     - advanced "warm-swap" support if used with DANIS506.ADD (rel. 1.1.9 or
       later)
     - support for PCCard (formerly: PCMCIA) ATAPI devices (like the Iomega
       PCMCIA ZIP-250 or the Iomega Click!40)
     - support for PCCard CD writers (CDRecord, RSJ)
     - the translation of old-style 6-byte SCSI commands into their more
       modern 10-byte counterparts is no longer hardcoded. The device is
       sensed now to check if it requires this translation.
     - like DaniS506.ADD, this driver stores boot messages internally for
       later readout. To view them, issue "copy ATAPI$ con:", to dump them
       into a file, issue "copy ATAPI$ anyfile".
     - automatic media unload on shutdown if desired
     - supports up to eight IDE channels
     - supports ATAPI MO drives (tested with Fujitsu 1.3GB and 2.3GB drives)
     - supports ATAPI units with more than one logical unit (LUN) built in.
       Examples are the Panasonic/IBM PD drive (tested) or some CD-ROM changers.
     - fix compatibility issues with the increasing number of devices that
       bluntly violate the ATAPI specs.
     - fix some hangs at driver initialization due to SCSI MODE_SENSE size
       problems with particular ATAPI units.
     - fix a hang at driver initialization due to slow recover from IDENTIFY
       commands seen with some ATAPI units.
***  - support for high interrupts (IRQ16 and higher)

###  Caution: this release doesn't work with DaniS506 v1.7.x or older!
	      it is meant to be used with DaniS506 v1.8.0 only.

     This means, all freeware utilites designed to work with SCSI devices
     are supposed to work with ATAPI devices as well:

       CDRecord, CDDA2WAV, TAR, ...

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     This driver supports all switches and options that IBMATAPI.FLT supports.

     In most cases, options prefaced with ! can be used with the ! modifier to
     explicitly disable the option.  Options are valid both with and without
     the ! modifer.

     The values in parentheses are the default values if the option is not
     present.

     Options may be prefixed by "-" instead of "/" as well.

     /!V						    (quiet)
	(not) Verbose mode
     /EJ						    (don't eject)
	eject medium at shutdown
     /ZA						    (default mapping)
	map ZIP drive to A:
     /!SCSI						    (export all)
	don't export any ATAPI devices as SCSI devices
     /RSJ						    (off)
	RSJ CDROM backdoor

     The export of ATAPI devices as SCSI-2 device can be enabled and/or disabled
     globally, per adapter channel, or per individual unit by adding the options
     /SCSI or /!SCSI. If these options are in front of any /A: option, they
     apply globally. If they come after an /A:x option but before any /U:
     option, they apply to adapter channel x and override the global setting. If
     they come after any /U:y option, then they apply to the single unit y only
     and override both the global and the adapter setting. Default is a global
     visibility of all ATAPI devices as SCSI devices.

     The export is globally disabled also and cannot be overridden if the driver
     is renamed to any name beginning with IBM (case insensitive). This avoids
     confusion of the OS/2 installer if you replace IBMIDECD.FLT on installation
     disk #1 by a renamed version of DaniATAPI.FLT.


     To enable booting OS/2 from an ATAPI ZIP drive, I introduced the new
     /ZA switch ('map ZIP to A:'). It takes effect only if the BIOS has mapped
     the ZIP to drive letter A: in order to boot from it; in all other cases
     the /ZA option is a no-op.

     If there are floppy disk drives in your system, then - as a side effect -
     /ZA remaps floppy drive A: to B:, and floppy drive B: (if present) is
     no longer accessable. Due to limitations in OS2DASD.DMD (?) floppy
     reads and writes are a little 'rocky' in this case.

     A boot from ZIP automatically locks the boot medium in the drive, media
     swapping is no longer possible! This lock is imposed automatically by
     OS2DASD. If you insist to eject the locked medium by the 'eject' command,
     this command obviously is routed into nirvana and causes a kernel trap.


     Some people (like me) don't like media left in removable media devices
     (especially ZIP drives) on system shutdown, but tend to forget to eject
     them before powering down the system. The new /EJ option fills the void. If
     /EJ appears in front of all /A:n options, it acts globally on all devices
     controlled by DANIATAPI.FLT; if /EJ comes after an /A:n but before
     accompanied /U:m options, it acts on all units of that adapter channel; if
     it comes after an /U:m option, /EJ acts only on that particular unit. In
     any case, all units marked by /EJ receive a command to eject inserted media
     on shutdown right after file systems are closed.


     Units marked as "warm-swappable" on DANIS506.ADD's command line (by
     /A:x /BAY) need the new option /TYPE: to advice DaniATAPI.FLT to report
     appropriate device types to the device managers.
     The same applies to PCCard adapter channels (found by /PCS on
     DANIS506.ADD's command line). This is done by additional characters
     designating the supported device types:

       'z' or 'Z': all ZIP drives
       'l' or 'L': the LS-120 drive
       'c' or 'C': all CD-ROM like devices (CD-ROM, CD-R/W, DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM)
       'w' or 'W': all CD writer like devices (CD-R/W, DVD-RAM)

     'W' includes 'C' but additionally enables the features required for proper
     operation of the RSJ CDWriter software even if there is no CD writer unit
     attached at boot time.

     There may be more in the future. Some examples on how to use this option:

     1) You have an IBM ThinkPad 600 and intend to plug a floppy drive, a
	CD-ROM, and a ZIP-100 into its UltraBay. The TPs have got the UltraBay
	connected to the secondary EIDE port. Then you need

	BASEDEV=DaniS506.ADD [other options] /A:1 /BAY
	BASEDEV=IBM1FLPY.ADD /A:0 /FORCE:1 /U:0 /F:1.44MB
	BASEDEV=DaniATAPI.FLT /A:1 /U:0 /TYPE:ZC

	(the adapter numbers above are correct!)

	This is tested on Dell Inspiron 4150 and should work on other notebooks
	as well.

     2) You have notebook which can be equipped with either a LS-120 drive,
	a DVD-ROM, or a CD writer. Then you need

	BASEDEV=DaniATAPI.FLT /A:x /U:y /TYPE:WL

     To pick the correct values for /A and /U have a look at the boot messages.

INSTALLATION
     Just copy DaniATAPI.FLT to bootdrive:\OS2\BOOT and add the line

     BASEDEV=DaniATAPI.FLT

     Make sure that all other ATAPI related drivers are inactive or come
     after DaniATAPI.FLT in your CONFIG.SYS.
     If you prefer chasing icons, you can do the copy using DDINSTAL; you
     still have to tidy up CONFIG.SYS!

     If you intend to run the BootOS utility or to install this filter driver
     on a 8.3-only filesystem, I recommend to rename the driver to DaniATAP.FLT.

INTEROPERABILITY TIPS
     This version of DaniATAPI.FLT works with DaniS506 v1.8.0 only. Due to
     changes in the inter device driver interface, this version of DaniS506
     no longer works with other ATAPI-related filter drivers. Thus there are
     no interoperability issues with them.

     Unfortunately, many people don't bother to read docs carefully enough or
     at all. So I state it here explicitely once again:

     To make SCSI or ATAPI devices visible to programs which use the ASPI API,
     you'll need the following two lines to be present in CONFIG.SYS!

     BASEDEV=OS2ASPI.DMD /ALL	    (/ALL makes all devices accessible)
     DEVICE=[path]\ASPIROUT.SYS or [path]\ASPINKK.SYS


     CDRecord:

     There are no further options required if you like to run CDRecord/2, but
     not RSJ with your CD writer. The writer is visible to CDRecord as a
     regular SCSI CD writer by default. Just run "CDRecord -scanbus" to locate
     the CD writer on one of the SCSI buses and memorize its address
     (bus,unit,lun).


     RSJ:

     DaniATAPI.FLT is fully compatible to the RSJ cdwriter filesystem and its
     accompanied utilities. In fact, if you run DaniATAPI.FLT instead of
     RSJIDECD.FLT you can take advantage of the improved data transfer modes
     (32bit PIO and busmaster DMA) on all supported chipsets (RSJIDECD.FLT is
     derived from IBMIDECD.FLT and thus supports busmaster DMA on Intel chipsets
     only). If your CD writer model is listed cddrv.inf you don't even need
     LOCKCDR.FLT; DaniATAPI.FLT reorders its SCSI unit mapping if it finds
     a CD writer unit so that RSJ is happy.

     So there are several choices available (listed in order of preference)

     1) BASEDEV=DaniATAPI.FLT <other options> /A:x /U:y /RSJ   or
					      /A:x /RSJ        or
					      /RSJ
	BASEDEV=LOCKCDR.FLT

	Both RSJ and CDRecord may use the writer. If your CD writer model isn't
	listed in cddrv.inf, LOCKCDR.FLT from RSJ 3.x will autodetect and
	autoconfigure it. DaniATAPI will install an additional backdoor to
	re-enable regular CD ROM operation via OS2CDROM.DMD (or replacements)
	even if it is hidden by LOCKCDR.FLT. You better prevent DaniATAPI.FLT
	from exporting the CD writer as SCSI device by applying one of the
	/!SCSI options, because it will be exported by LOCKCDR.FLT now (too).

	RSJ and UDF peacefully coexist now.

     2) BASEDEV=DaniATAPI.FLT

	This enables full use of the CD writer unit as regular CD ROM device,
	RSJ writer device, and CDRecord writer device. If your particular model
	isn't listed in RSJ's cddrv.inf, then you need to paste the LOCKCDR.FLT
	autodetection info from the RSJ control panel.

     3) BASEDEV=DaniATAPI.FLT </!SCSI> or </A:x /!SCSI> or </A:x /U:y /!SCSI>
	BASEDEV=LOCKCDR.FLT

	This disables using the CD writer unit as a regular CD ROM drive. You
	better prevent DaniATAPI.FLT from exporting the CD writer as SCSI device
	by applying one of the /!SCSI options, because it will be exported by
	LOCKCDR.FLT now (too). Both RSJ and CDRecord may use the writer. If your
	CD writer model isn't listed in cddrv.inf, LOCKCDR.FLT from RSJ 3.x and
	above will autodetect and autoconfigure it.

     4) BASEDEV=DaniATAPI.FLT
	BASEDEV=LOCKCDR.FLT
	DEVICE=JJSCDROM.DMD /W

	This is similar to the section above, but DaniATAPI will not install
	the additional backdoor; with the /W option JJSCDROM will grab the
	WORM unit exported by LOCKCDR.FLT.


     BackAgain/2K:

     The vendor supplied ATAPI tape driver (f.e. CDSEIDE.FLT,BTSEIDE.FLT)
     doesn't work with DaniS506 v1.8.0.


     SANE:

     SANE users may find that the SCSI bus number, for their scanner, will
     change when DaniATAPI.FLT is used. You may need to run FIND-SCANNER.EXE,
     and edit the scanner address in the *.CONF file, to correct the address.
     This should be a one time change, unless you switch back to the IBM
     supplied drivers.


     UDF:

     Lots of UDF failures can be attributed to flaws with particular versions of
     OS2CDROM.DMD or JJSCDROM.DMD. Best results with UDF 2.1.2 were seen with
     OS2CDROM.DMD build level 10.127.

     If you see UDF formatting failing like this

       [d:\]format w: /FS:UDF /F
       The type of file system for the disk is CDFS.
       WARNING: Formatting will erase ALL data on this disk.
       Continue (Yes or No)? Y
       Formatting is in progress...Format failed.
       Internal error

     then you probably have to blank the CD-RW before. CDRecord is recommended:

       [d:\]cdrecord blank=fast -eject -speed 10


     FUJITSU MO drivers

     these are obsolete now, everything is handled by DaniATAPI.FLT and the
     DASD manager (both large floppy and partitioned media).
